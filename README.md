# effect-weather

A CLI weather application built with Effect that fetches and displays current weather information for any location using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Setup

1. Get an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
2. Set the environment variable: `export OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

## Usage

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun start
```

Enter a location when prompted to get current weather data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.3.1. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
